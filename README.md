## Updating the libcore

When a new version of the libcore is available, we need to update our bindings.

| Prerequisite                                   | Remarks |
| ============================================== | ========================================= |
| [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)   | Only needed if you plan to build in local |
| [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) |                                           |

1. Check out [lib core project](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/lib-ledger-core)
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 --branch <branch_or_version_tag> https://github.com/LedgerHQ/lib-ledger-core
   ```

2. Copy `build-jar.sh` and `build-jar-linux.sh` to the lib core project folder
   ```bash
   cp $WALLET_DAEMON_FOLDER/build-jar.sh $LIB_CORE_FOLDER
   cp $WALLET_DAEMON_FOLDER/build-jar-linux.sh $LIB_CORE_FOLDER
   ```

3. `cd` to lib core folder
   ```bash
   cd $LIB_CORE_FOLDER
   ```

4. Two possible situations: either you want a fresh build from your local machine, or you want to
   grab the official lib core artifacts.
   1. For building on your machine, run the script `build-jar.sh` with command: `mac`, `linux` or `all`.
      MacOS can build both `mac` and `linux`. Linux can only build `linux`.
      ```bash
      # Build for mac only. You may want to do this when developing,
      # it's much faster than build for both mac and linux
      bash build-jar.sh mac

      # Build for linux. Linux build is using docker.
      bash build-jar.sh linux

      # Build for both mac and linux
      bash build-jar.sh all
      ```
   2. For getting the official release, pass an extra argument `dl` to the command invocation.
      ```bash
      # Get only the mac release artifacts.
      ./build-jar.sh mac dl

      # Get only the linux artifacts.
      ./build-jar.sh linux dl

      # Get both.
      ./build-jar.sh all dl
      ```

5. Then, you find the jar file in `$LIB_CORE_FOLDER/../build-jar/target/scala-<version>/build-jar-<version>.jar`.
   Replace the `ledger-lib-core.jar` in the lib folder with this file.
   ```bash
   mv $LIB_CORE_FOLDER/../build-jar/target/scala-<version>/build-jar-<version>.jar $WALLET_DAEMON_FOLDER/lib/ledger-lib-core.jar
   ```

6. Push the changes to upstream

7. Add a tag on the new commit with the version of the ledger-core-lib, or the commit
   hash if no version was tagged

## Using Wallet Daemon with PostgreSQL

### Setup

1. Make sure to have a PostgreSQL server running,

2. For integration tests make sure to create required databases, you could use the `db.sh` for that:

    ```
    ./dbs.sh <host> <port>
    ```
    To drop databases simply run: 
    ```
    ./dbs.sh <host> <port> drop
    ```

3. For tests with users' databases (i.e. `database.db` created), please use, in an analogous way, `client_dbs.sh` script.

### Configuration

1. By default, Wallet Daemon is using Sqlite3 by default, to activate PostgreSQL set: 
    ```
    CORE_DATABASE_ENGINE=postgres
    ``` 
2. Setting the PostgreSQL connection mandatory infos by setting : 
`CORE_PG_HOST`, `CORE_PG_PORT`, `CORE_PG_USER` and `CORE_PG_PWD` 
which are respectively the hostname, the port exposed by postgres the user and the password to use for establishing the connection.
We are supporting SSL connections. 

3. It is possible to set the connection pool size per wallet pool (e.g. by client) thanks to: 
`PG_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE_PER_WALLET_POOL`, which is equal to `2` by default and also a prefix name for every databases created by the libcore by setting `CORE_PG_DB_NAME_PREFIX` example : `CORE_PG_DB_NAME_PREFIX=WD_`

### Run Dockerized Wallet Daemon locally with docker compose
Please have a look on  [Docker compose configuration file](docker-compose.yml) for more details on configuration. 
This will create a PostgreSql instance with SSL enabled and the latest development image of wallet daemon ready to talk with.

```
docker-compose up 
```
